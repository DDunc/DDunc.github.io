    <h1>Clade: JavaScript and Regex</h1>
    <p>Clade is a work in progress with the eventual goal of being able to recreate the historical vowel and consonant shifts between English and German orthography. Because English and German are part of the same West Germanic language family, this tool could help language learners identify previously unrecognized cognates and rapidly expand their active vocabulary.
