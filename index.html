          <p>Hello, my name is David Duncan, and I'm a self-taught coder of about nine months currently taking a part-time Front End Web Development course in Seattle. My eventual plan is to attend an immersive coding school and become a full stack JavaScript developer. </p>

<p><strong>Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/DOM</strong>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/DDunc/rafttimes.html">The Raft</a> was my first (very modest) project created entirely in vanilla JavaScript. I taught myself basic javascript, recreated the basic game three different times using a different approach to structuring the code each time, and learned just how screwed up the DOM really is. </p>

<p><strong>jQuery/Javascript/CSS/HTML5/Bootstrap</strong>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/DDunc/sunk/index.html">Sunk</a> is a work in progress, conceived of as a hybrid of interactive fiction and resource management. I've learned a significant amount of jQuery and CSS so far as well as becoming more familiar with native object methods, getters and setters, etc. I've learned how convenient Bootstrap can be, but also about some of its limitations. I've really only scratched the surface though, and the "game" portions still need a lot of work in order for there to be meaningful decisions. </p>

<p><strong>RegEx/JavaScript/Writing Modular Code</strong>
<br> 
Germanizer is a work in progress with the goal of being able to recreate most (if not all) of the historical vowel and consonant shifts between english and german orthography.  As both English and German are part of the same West Germanic language family, this tool could help language learners identify non-obvious English/German cognates and rapidly expand their active vocabulary. For now it functions is more limited and mostly produces funny sounding faux-german, but I found a good use for it anyway.</p>

<p>This project is serving as my continuing introduction to regular expressions, regular expression methods in Javascript, and for thinking about when it's better to use JavaScript conditionals and when it's better to write complex regular expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Future Projects</strong>
I'm still very much a novice at using the terminal, I find Git somewhat unintuitive, I've spent a lot of time struggling with a few different APIs and rarely gotten useful results, and my experience with Node is next to nothing. I do not know when I'll be able to attend a code school, so I will continue to attempt to develop a greater familiarity in these areas on my own.</p>
