          <p>Hello, my name is David Duncan, and I'm a self-taught coder of about nine months currently taking a part-time Front End Web Development course in Seattle. My eventual plan is to attend an immersive coding school and become a full stack JavaScript developer. </p>

<p><strong>Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/DOM</strong>
<br>
Raft Times was my first (very modest) text-game project and I created it entirely in vanilla JavaScript. I taught myself basic JavaScript, recreated the basic game three different times using a different approach to structuring the code each time, and learned just how screwed up the DOM really is. </p>

<p><strong>jQuery/JavaScript/CSS/HTML5/Bootstrap</strong>
<br>
Sunk is a work in progress, conceived of as a hybrid of interactive fiction and resource management. I've learned a significant amount of jQuery and CSS so far as well as becoming more familiar with native object methods, getters and setters, etc. I've learned how convenient Bootstrap can be, but also about some of its limitations. I've really only scratched the surface though, and the "game" portions still need a lot of work in order for there to be meaningful decisions. </p>

<p><strong>RegEx/JavaScript/Separation of Concerns/Modularity</strong>
<br> 
Germanizer is a work in progress with the goal of being able to recreate most (if not all) of the historical vowel and consonant shifts between english and german pronunciation/orthography. Because English and German are part of the same West Germanic language family, this tool could help language learners identify non-obvious English/German cognates and rapidly expand their active vocabulary. There are a number of technical challenges to making it do more than produce funny sounding faux-German, but that may have its uses too.</p>

<p>This project is serving as my continuing introduction to regular expressions, regular expression methods in JavaScript, and for thinking about how to manage complexity.</p>
